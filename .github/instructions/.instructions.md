Always choose the most modern api. both external rest apis as well as internal libraries and frameworks. Avoid deprecated apis and legacy approaches. Use the standard libraries and build-in over third-party libraries whenever possible.


always use proper types and interfaces in TypeScript. Avoid using `any` type and if necessary use `unknown` instead and narrow it down later.
