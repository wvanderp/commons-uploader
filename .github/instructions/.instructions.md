Always choose the most modern api. both external rest apis as well as internal libraries and frameworks. Avoid deprecated apis and legacy approaches. Use the standard libraries, html features and build-in over third-party libraries whenever possible.

Always use proper types and interfaces in TypeScript. Avoid using `any` type and if necessary use `unknown` instead and narrow it down later.

Pay attention to the architecture and structure of the code. Follow best practices for organizing files, folders, and modules. Ensure that the code is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain and testable.

Make sure that tricky code is thoroughly tested with unit tests. Use mocking and stubbing where necessary to isolate the code under test. Ensure that edge cases and error scenarios are covered in the tests.
